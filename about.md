Mt. Timpanogos — Recce for a 50-mile mountain race, Sept 2024.  



I’ve spent most of my life learning how to perform under pressure — sometimes by choice, sometimes by necessity.  

The details don’t matter as much as the pattern: challenges, discipline, adaptation. I’ve seen how hardship forges clarity, and how small, consistent actions can rebuild almost anything.  

Life has a way of testing every theory you hold. The lessons that survived the furnace are the ones I share here.

## What I Do Now

Today I manage investment portfolios and build AI tools — the unifying theme is *optimization*:  
how small, consistent choices compound into extraordinary outcomes.  

This space is where I share what I’ve learned (and what I’m still figuring out):  
science-backed health practices, frameworks for discipline, and stories about the hard edges of growth.

If you strip away the spreadsheets and training logs, it all comes down to one question:

> Am I living a life I'd actually choose again?
