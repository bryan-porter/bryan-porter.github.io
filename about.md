Hi, I'm **Bryan Porter**. Welcome to my personal blog where I explore topics at the intersection of technology, finance, and data-driven decision making.

## What I Do

I'm passionate about using technology and data to solve real-world problems. My interests span software development, quantitative analysis, financial markets, and building tools that make complex topics more accessible.

## My Focus Areas

**Technology & Development**
I enjoy working with modern web technologies, data visualization, and creating clean, functional applications. Check out my [retro terminal portfolio](/projects) to see some of my projects in action.

**Finance & Investing**
I'm fascinated by financial markets and investment strategies. I believe in combining fundamental analysis with quantitative approaches to make better-informed decisions.

**Data & Analytics**
From building dashboards to running statistical analyses, I love finding insights hidden in data and presenting them in clear, actionable ways.

## About This Site

This blog is built with Jekyll using the excellent [Scriptor theme](https://github.com/JustGoodThemes/Scriptor-Jekyll-Theme) by JustGoodThemes. The site also features a unique DOS-style terminal interface in the [Projects](/projects) sectionâ€”a nostalgic nod to early computing that showcases some of my work.
