## The Myth of Either/Or

Somewhere along the way, fitness got divided into tribes.  
Endurance athletes that don't do strength will wither away, strength athletes that don't do endurance can't sustain.     

Health isn’t about specialization. It’s about resilience — the ability to **adapt**.  
That’s what being a hybrid athlete means: strong enough to carry load, fit enough to sustain it, and disciplined to keep doing it for decades.

## What “Hard to Kill” Really Means

It’s not about being extreme. It’s about being **ready**.  
A body that can sprint, hike, lift, and play with your kids.  
A heart that can handle stress without breaking.  
A mind that stays sharp when things go sideways.

When I talk about being “hard to kill,” I’m not romanticizing suffering — I’m describing robustness.  
The ability to withstand volatility, both physical and emotional.  

That’s what strength and endurance training really teach: how to keep showing up under load.

## The Hybrid Equation

I think of training like portfolio construction:

| Category                    | Allocation            | Objective                                                |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strength**                | 2–4 sessions/week     | Preserve and build muscle; improve power-to-weight ratio |
| **Zone 1 & 2 Cardio**       | 4-12 hrs/week         | Build mitochondrial density and metabolic flexibility    |
| **High Intensity / Zone 5** | 1 session/week        | Maintain top-end performance; raise VO₂ max              |
| **Mobility / Prehab**       | 10 mins / 1-2x per ay | Prevent injuries, improve longevity                      |
| **Recovery**                | Daily                 | Sleep, nutrition, breathwork, and active recovery        |

Your body *is* a portfolio. Consistency is the compound interest.
