## About This Site

This site combines a clean, minimal blog with a unique retro terminal interface. The blog uses the beautiful [Scriptor theme](https://github.com/JustGoodThemes/Scriptor-Jekyll-Theme) by JustGoodThemes, while my projects section features a nostalgic DOS-style interface for a fun contrast.

## Let's Connect

I'm passionate about learning and sharing knowledge. Feel free to explore the site and check back regularly for new posts on topics that interest meâ€”and hopefully you too.

Thanks for stopping by!
