## The Reframe

You are **not your stats**, and your worth isn’t determined by calories or the scale.  
You’re beautiful inside and out — already enough.  
If this framework doesn’t fit, take what serves you and leave the rest. No judgement.  
Your journey is your own, and the best progress is the one you can sustain with self-respect.

When you feed consistently, sleep enough, and move daily, your biology stops hoarding energy for famine.  
You stop swinging between extremes and start compounding progress quietly.



I usually end with this, but it's worth bringing to the top this time.

> **TL;DR**  
> Start with a ~**500 kcal/day deficit**, adequate protein, and consistent resistance + aerobic work.  
> Anything more extreme may look faster, but it’s usually a short-term trade-off against long-term performance and metabolic health.



## The Physics

Losing fat is first a matter of **math**—and then **behavior**.  
If you want reliable progress, your system has to be precise and repeatable.

---

### Energy Deficit

- A daily deficit of roughly **500 kcal** is a well-supported starting point.  
  It produces about **0.5–1 % body-weight loss per week** (≈ 1 lb per week for many).  
  ([WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/diet/calorie-deficit?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
- Clinical guidelines extend the safe range to **500–750 kcal/day** under professional supervision.  
  ([PMC8017325](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8017325/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
- Larger deficits accelerate loss but raise risks: lean-mass loss, hormonal disruption, and rebound.

---

### Rate & Adjustment

- **Target:** 0.5–1.0 % body-weight loss per week.  
  - Faster → higher fatigue and muscle loss risk.  
  - Slower → easier to maintain lean mass and consistency.  
- Re-evaluate maintenance every **10–15 lb lost** or after **2–3 weeks plateau**.  
- Insert **maintenance phases** (2–4 weeks at maintenance calories) to restore hormones, metabolic rate, and mental freshness.

---

### Training Integration

- **Resistance training** 2–3×/week protects muscle and preserves metabolic rate.  
- **Aerobic work** (Zone 2 / 150 min+ per week) improves fat oxidation and recovery.  
- Exercise quality matters more than duration; you can’t out-train inconsistency or sleep debt.

### Macronutrients

| Nutrient    | Target                                    | Why It Matters                                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Protein** | 1.6–2.2 g/kg body weight (≈ 0.7–1.0 g/lb) | Preserves lean mass, improves satiety, raises thermic effect of food. ([PMC8017325](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8017325/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) |
| **Fat**     | 20–35 % of total calories                 | Supports hormones, cell membranes, and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. ([Dietary Guidelines 2020–2025](https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) |
| **Carbs**   | Remaining calories                        | Fuels training and recovery; flexible based on activity level and preference. |

### Fiber, Hydration & Electrolytes

- **Fiber:** ≥ 30–40 g/day → stabilizes glucose, supports gut health, increases satiety.  
- **Hydration:** ≈ 35 mL/kg body weight baseline (~2.5 L for most adults).  
  Add **0.5–1 L/hour** of exercise in heat.  
- **Sodium:** Replace **500–1,000 mg** sodium per liter of sweat in long or hot sessions.  
  (Sweat sodium varies from < 200 mg to > 2,000 mg/L across individuals.)
